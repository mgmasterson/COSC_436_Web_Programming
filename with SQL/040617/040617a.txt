        <BODY>Many students at EMU may not know that EMU does offer Articualtion agreements
            with other schools in the state. Those agreements allows students to take classes
            at a community college, for example, and then transfer for a Bacholer Degree at EMU.
            Recently a student at EMU had trouble with his when graduation evaluators ran his audit.
            He says that they ran the audit and told him that in his major that two courses were not
            checked off. After he talked to the department and they confirmed via a different person at
            the college that the evaluators needed to use the articulation agreement year that he started
            at the other community college. When ran by using the correct year, the courses that he needed disappeared
            and was able to continue with his degree. When the student was asked for the comment he said "
            All I want to do is to help other students in this situation."</BODY>
